# CarND-PID-Control-P4
Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree - PID Control project

# Overview

This project implements a [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) to control a car in Udacity's simulator([it could be downloaded here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)). The simulator sends cross-track error, speed and angle to the PID controller(PID) using [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) and it receives the steering angle ([-1, 1] normalized) and the throttle to drive the car. The PID uses the [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) WebSocket implementation. Udacity provides a seed project to start from on this project ([here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project)).

# Prerequisites

The project has the following dependencies (from Udacity's seed project):

- cmake >= 3.5
- make >= 4.1
- gcc/g++ >= 5.4
- Udacity's simulator.

For instructions on how to install these components on different operating systems, please, visit [Udacity's seed project](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project). As this particular implementation was done on Mac OS, the rest of this documentation will be focused on Mac OS. I am sorry to be that restrictive.

In order to install the necessary libraries, use the [install-mac.sh](./install-mac.sh).

# Compiling and executing the project

In order to build the project there is a `./build.sh` script on the repo root. It will create the `./build` directory and compile de code. This is an example of the ouput of this script:

```
> ./build.sh
-- The C compiler identification is AppleClang 8.0.0.8000042
-- The CXX compiler identification is AppleClang 8.0.0.8000042
-- Check for working C compiler: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/cc
-- Check for working C compiler: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/cc -- works

```

The project could be executed directly using `./build/pid` or if there are some modification and a build is needed you can use the script `./makeAndrun.sh`:

```
> ./makeAndrun.sh
[100%] Built target pid
Listening to port 4567
```

Now the PID controller is running and listening on port 4567 for messages from the simulator. Next step is to open Udacity's simulator.Using the right arrow, you need to go to the Project 4: PID Controller project and click the "Select" button:

# Implementation

The PID implementation is done on the [./src/PID.cpp](./src/PID.cpp). The [PID::UpdateError](./src/PID.cpp#L28) method calculates proportional, integral and derivative errors and the [PID::TotalError](./src/PID.cpp#L37) calculates the total error using the appropriate coefficients.

## Reflection

- The "P" for proportional means that the car will steer in proportion to the cross-track error, or CTE. CTE is essentially how far from the middle line of the road the car is. This makes sense, as if the car is to the left of the line then you would want to steer to the right; if it is far to the left of the middle with a high CTE then you want a higher steering angle. However, if the coefficient is set too high for P, the car will oscillate a ton, as the car will constantly overcorrect and overshoot the middle. If the coefficient is too low, the car may react too slowly to curves when the car gets off-center with a higher CTE.

- The "I" for integral sums up all CTEs up to that point, such that too many negative CTEs (in this case, meaning the car has been to the left of the middle of the lane for awhile) will drive up this value, causing the car to turn back toward the middle, preventing the car from driving on one side of the lane the whole time. If the coefficient is too high for I, the car tends to have quicker oscillations, and does not tend to get up to a quick speed. A low coefficent for I will cause the car to tend to drift to one side of the lane or the other for longer periods of time.

- The "D" for derivate is the change in CTE from one value to the next. This means that 1) if the derivative is quickly changing, the car will correct itself (i.e. higher steering angle) faster, such as in the case of a curve, and 2) if the car is moving outward from the middle, this will cause the steering to get larger (as the derivative sign will match the proportional sign), but if the car is moving toward the center (meaning the derivative value will be negative), the car's steering angle will get smoothed out, leading to a more smoother driving experience. Too high of a coefficient leads to almost constant steering angle changes of large degrees, where although the car will be well-centered it can hardly move. Too low of a D coefficient will lead to the oscillations being too high with more overshooting.

## How the final hyperparameters were chosen.

The parameters were chosen manually by try and error. The final parameters where [P: 0.1, I: 0.0, D: 3.0]. In addition to that the speed/throttle of the vehicle is controlled (see [here](./src/main.cpp#L71)) by comparing the actual velocity of the car with a maxiumum velocity that can been set [here](./src/main.cpp#L18).
